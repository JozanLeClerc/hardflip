# hardflip

The best TUI tool to connect to your distant hosts.

## Dependencies

Install those if you need them :

+ `sshpass` if you are using passwords with SSH (honnestly use keys instead)
+ `xfreerdp` for RDP. Called `freerdp2-x11` on some distros
+ `openstack` for OpenStack CLI.
+ `gpg` to crypt passwords. You can store them in plain text if you prefer but
i wouldn't recommend that option.
+ `go`
